PHP Assignment Rock, Paper, Scissors Game
Purpose:
This program is a set of 3 PHP pages for a game of rock,
paper, scissors where you select which guess you want to
play and the computer will randomly select a response and
based on the two responses will declare a winner.
You have the option to play multiple times and a score is
tallied and displayed at the end of the round and the game.

The 3 PHP pages that make up this game are:
welcome.php - Starting point for game
game.php - The actual game
recap.php - Used to handle replaying the game

All three PHP pages are needed to run the game.
